                Define a check interval, a host and a port to check against. If you don't know what to set here, the
                default values (using Google's DNS server) should work. If you have concerns about using
                that, define the IP and port of a different online server that you trust and that has a high
                availability.

                If you also want to check if name resolution works (strongly recommended), define a host name
                to check name resolution against. If you don't know what to set here, the default value
                (OctoPrint's domain) should work. If you don't want to perform regular resolution checks along
                side with the general connectivity check, leave the field empty.
